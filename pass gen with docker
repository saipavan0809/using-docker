This project is a Python application that generates a random password each time it is executed. The password generation is designed to be secure, incorporating a combination of letters, digits, and special characters for enhanced randomness.

To make the application more portable and easier to deploy across different environments, it has been containerized using Docker. The Docker setup includes:

A base image (python:3.x).
The Python script is copied into the container.
Any necessary dependencies are installed.
The password generation script runs automatically when the container starts.
With Docker, the application can be run on any machine with Docker installed, ensuring consistent execution regardless of the local environment.
